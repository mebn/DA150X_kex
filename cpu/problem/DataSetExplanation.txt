- In the first line there are 3 numbers: number of jobs, number of machines, and number of transporters
- Every row represents one job: the first number is the number of operations (k) of that job, the second number (let's say k>=1) is the number of machines that can process the first operation; then according to k, there are k pairs of numbers (machine,processing time) that specify which are the machines and the processing times; the following numbers is the number of preceding operations and the operation numbers; then the data for the second operation and so on...
- Following the job data are the transport times between machines: in the first row, the first number is the transport time between the first machine to the second machine, the second number is to the third machine, and so on..; then in the second row, the first number is the distance from the second machine to the third machine, and so on..

First row = 2 jobs, 3 machines, 2 transporters
Second row: Job 1 has 3 operations, the first operation can be processed by 2 machines that is machine 1 with processing time 5 and machine 2 with processing time 4. The first operation is preceded by 0 operation and the thrid operation is preceded by 1 operation which is the second operation
Forth row: Transport time between machine 1 and machine 2 is 3 and between machine 1 and machine 3 is 4
Fifth row: Transport time between machine 2 and machine 3 is 2
